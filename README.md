### BPE Structured Pricing Assistant - Version 4.0 (Hybrid Search) 💊 

This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to pharmaceutical pricing assistance by combining structured MongoDB lookups with AI fallback search using vector embeddings and GPT-4.
This system is designed as a prototype — in production, pricing data would likely come from automated ingestion pipelines or enterprise pricing databases.


 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Structured Data First:**  
   - Pricing records (drug, pharmacy, location, price, etc.) are inserted into MongoDB (`drug_pricing` collection).
   - When a user asks a question, the assistant first tries to **find exact matches** by drug name and city using MongoDB queries.

2. **Vector Search + GPT-4 Fallback:**  
   - If no exact pricing match is found, the system falls back to **vector search** (Voyage AI embeddings) and **GPT-4** to generate helpful recommendations based on semantic similarity.
