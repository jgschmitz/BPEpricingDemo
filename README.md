### BPE Structured Pricing Assistant - Version 4.0 (Hybrid Search) üíä 

This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to pharmaceutical pricing assistance by combining structured MongoDB lookups with AI fallback search using vector embeddings and GPT-4.
This system is designed as a prototype ‚Äî in production, pricing data would likely come from automated ingestion pipelines or enterprise pricing databases.


 üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Structured Data First:**  
   - Pricing records (drug, pharmacy, location, price, etc.) are inserted into MongoDB (`drug_pricing` collection).
   - When a user asks a question, the assistant first tries to **find exact matches** by drug name and city using MongoDB queries.
<br>
2. **Vector Search + GPT-4 Fallback:**  
   - If no exact pricing match is found, the system falls back to **vector search** (Voyage AI embeddings) and **GPT-4** to generate helpful recommendations based on semantic similarity.

 üöÄ How to Run It (Colab or Local Jupyter)

1. **Clone or download** this repository / Gist.

2. **Open `BPE_Structured_v4.ipynb`** in:
   - Google Colab (recommended for easiest setup)
   - or Jupyter Notebook locally.

3. **Install requirements** (Colab will auto-prompt if missing):
   ```bash
   !pip install pymongo openai voyageai
